<h2>Purpose of this project</h2>
<p>The Kowie Museum History project provides a service where details of people and events in the Eastern Cape of South Africa can be recorded and researched.</p>
<p>
Although the initial motivation for this project was to record the information gathered by Morse Jones about the 1820 Settlers, it was decided that 
the project should record details about any individuals, wherever they come from. 
In general, the people mentioned will be of historical significance, although certain non-controversial information on living individuals may be captured 
e.g. a record of mayors or other noteworthy individuals.
