Kowie Museum History project
2018-12-27
The Kowie Museum History project provides a service where details of people and events in 
the Eastern Cape of South Africa can be recorded and researched.

Although the initial motivation for this project was to record the information gathered by 
Morse Jones about the 1820 Settlers, it was decided that the project should record details 
about any individuals, wherever they come from.  In general, the people mentioned will be
of historical significance, although certain non-contriversial information on living individuals
may be captured e.g. a record of mayors or other noteworthy individuals.

If any information found on the site is thought to be inaccurate or inappropriate, 
please send details to curator@kowiemuseum.co.za .
